# Koop-elasticsearch-app

An express.js application that shows you how to deploy an instance of koop together with Elasticsearch as its primary data cache.

This is **not** a koop provider that exposes Elasticsearch data as feature layers, but that code can be found here: https://github.com/koopjs/koop-provider-elasticsearch.

## Install

  ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/koopjs/koop-elasticsearch-app.git
    cd koop-elasticsearch-app
    npm install 
    node server.js  
  ```
